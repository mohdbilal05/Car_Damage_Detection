    This application demonstrates an **Automated Car Damage Detection System** developed for VROOM Cars.
    [cite_start]The goal of this project is to quickly and accurately classify the condition of a vehicle's front or rear based on an uploaded image[cite: 11, 15].

    [cite_start]The system uses a trained machine learning model to classify images into one of six specific damage categories with an accuracy target of at least 75%[cite: 16, 25].
